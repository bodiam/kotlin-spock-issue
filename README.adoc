= Spock and Kotlin

Demonstration for Spock with Kotlin bug

The Spock code is testing the Kotlin code, but Spock doesn't seem to be compatible with the final behaviour of Kotlin, and complains with the error:

----
groovy.lang.GroovyRuntimeException: Could not find matching constructor for: address.AddressService(google.GoogleService$$EnhancerByCGLIB$$6fa9e3ff)

	at test.AddressServiceSpec.find address(AddressServiceSpec.groovy:23)
----

This error is reproduced by running the AddressSpec test, or just by doing a `./gradlew clean test`
